Project #1: Guessing Game
--------------------------

	This program will create a game which will run the Pseudo-Random Number Generator to pick the 101st random number for the user to guess. Users can use a command line option to change the value of the seed integer. The game will keep repeating until the user picks the correct answer or gives up. If the user guesses a number closer to the random number, then they will get a message saying warmer. Otherwise they will get a message saying colder. If the user types 0 they can give up.

Prerequisities 
---------------
Linux OS if you want to run a command line in the terminal
OS that supports python
Python 3.5.2 which can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads/
guess.py 
MyPRNG.py

Running the Program
--------------------
	You can type python guess.py to execute the program that will use default values or you can use the command line in the linux terminal by typing the following command python guess.py -h -v -s 101 -m 1 -M 400. You dont have to use -h unless you need help understanding how to execute the program. The -v will be used to turn on debugging messages which is optional to include in the command line as well. If you don't put any value for the value after -s it will default to the time value which can have decimals as the answer. An example would be 100.25 as a decimal. The -m will be the minimum value of 1 if left empty. The -M can be as big as 1000, it is optional as well.

	Once the program is running, feel free to guess the number that was generated by the PRNG algorithm. It will keep prompting you to guess until you guess the exact number or you can give up by typing 0. The hint that you will receive is, that the game will say warmer as you are getting closer to the number, and colder if you are guessing further away.
